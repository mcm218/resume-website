For this entry, I decided to make a top down game where you played as a vampire who had to suck blood every 10 seconds to stay alive. The twist was that you had to pickpocket your victim and check their blood donor card to ensure they had a compatitible blood type. Overall, I was happy with this game jam and how it turned out. Currently working on a mobile version of the game to release on both Andorid and iOS.",

This time, we had a group with more writing experience, so we wanted to lean into that with a visual novel that follows a chimp trying to escape a jungle science facility. Unfortunately, we ended up not having enough time so we didn't have as many random encounters and the overall combat was weak.",
